# Libi Tools

A collection of a few libraries I have developed as part of a Vanilla JS framework for building advanced browser-based interfaces.
It also includes some tools to help interact with the Solana blockchain with Vanilla JS.

The documentation is currently lacking; I will slowly add to it over time.

The goal of this repository is mainly to help developers understand the framework that wraps the libi engine.
